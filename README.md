# Password-cracker-python

A simple password cracker which cracks the password by matching hashes.
I have done this on md5 hash.

# Working
* It has 3 files:
  - crack.py has actual code
  - rockyou.txt has password list
  - md5hash.txt has hash of 12345678
  
  User passes a md5 hash and then gives filename which in our case rockyou.txt and then it compares the hash.
